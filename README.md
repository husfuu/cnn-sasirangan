# Sasirangan Image Classification with CNN

Sasirangan is a traditional cloth originating from South Kalimantan which has been designated by the Ministry of Education and Culture as one of 33 traditional fabrics of intangible cultural heritage in Indonesia. Sasirangan comes from the word sirang or merang which in Banjar language means stretching or sewing techniques by hand (Kholis, 2016; Annisa, 2014). The motif is made by stitching with basting technique. Initially, sasirangan cloth was believed to be able to treat diseases and drive away evil spirits, so its production was restricted. But now, the production of sasirangan cloth has been expanded in various needs, one of which is the need for appearance. In general, the manufacture is still using the traditional way.

Since 2010, the Sasirangan tradition has been officially recognized as one of Indonesia's unique Intangible Cultural Heritage in the field of Traditional Craft Skills and Proficiency originating from South Kalimantan.
